# Vector Home Robot WebService
The examples in this repo demonstrate how to set up your own web server in Node.js and integrate it with Anki's Python SDK 
to interact with your Vector robot. The examples were designed for running Node.js on an Ubuntu 18.04 server, but should run on any platform supported by Node.
